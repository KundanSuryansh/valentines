# Background images for each day

Add your own background images here for each Valentine's day page.

## Expected filenames

- `day1.jpg` — Day 1: First Glance
- `day2.jpg` — Day 2: First Conversation
- `day3.jpg` — Day 3: First Date
- `day4.jpg` — Day 4: First Confession
- `day5.jpg` — Day 5: Ordinary Magic
- `day6.jpg` — Day 6: Adventures Together
- `day7.jpg` — Day 7: Through Thick and Thin
- `day8.jpg` — Day 8: Forever Yours

## Using local images

Edit the `backgroundImage` field in each JSON file in `src/data/`:

```json
"backgroundImage": "/valentines/images/day1.jpg"
```

(Use `/images/day1.jpg` if your site is served from the root, or `/valentines/images/day1.jpg` for GitHub Pages with base `/valentines/`.)

## Placeholder images

If no local images are added, the app uses placeholder URLs from picsum.photos (set in each JSON file). You can replace those with your own image URLs at any time.
